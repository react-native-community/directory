> __Note:__ If your package is within a monorepo on GitHub, eg: https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/expo-web-browser, then the name, description, homepage, and topics (keywords) will be extracted from package.json for that subrepo. GitHub stats will be based on the monorepo, because there isn't really another option.

## How do I run my own version locally?

#### Prerequisites

- Node LTS

#### Commands

```sh
yarn && yarn start
```

You should be able to visit `localhost:3000` in your browser.

## How do I run `yarn data:update` with keys?

- Visit https://github.com/settings/developers to get your keys (don't worry about the callback URL, put whatever you want).
- Load the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable into your shell.

This command creates site data in `./assets/data.json`

```sh
GITHUB_TOKEN=<*> yarn data:update
```

## How do I deploy to production?

Get a commit on `master` and it will be automatically deployed.

## I don't like your website, can I hit an API instead and build my own better stuff?

Sure, go for it!
